# Echoes-of-Art: Translating Audio into Art with Neural Style Transfer

## Project Overview

Echoes of Art is a creative project for IAT460 that transforms sound into visual art using Neural Style Transfer (NST). This project takes audio inputs (such as environmental noise, speech, music, etc.), converts them into spectrograms, and applies pre-trained deep learning models to generate unique images inspired by five famous paintings. The result is a visual representation of sound that project challenges how sound, which is traditionally viewed as an auditory sensation, can be reimagined in the visual sense.

## Features
- Audio-to-Spectrogram Conversion: The input audio is converted into a spectrogram, a visual representation of the sound frequencies.
- Neural Style Transfer (NST): Using a selection of pre-trained NST models, the project merges the spectrogram with famous artistic styles, such as Impressionism, Cubism, and Abstract Expressionism.
- Artistic Interpretation: The project introduces 'creative mistakes' into the process, ensuring each artwork is unique. These 'mistakes' include random distortions, shifts in color, and unexpected brushstroke patterns, adding an element of unpredictability and creativity.
- Multiple Style Options: Users can choose from several classical painting styles to apply to their spectrograms.
