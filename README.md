## Echoes-of-Art: Translating Audio into Art with Neural Style Transfer

# Project Overview

Audio-to-Art is a creative project that transforms sound into visual art using Neural Style Transfer (NST). This project takes audio inputs (such as environmental noise, speech, music, etc.), converts them into spectrograms, and applies pre-trained deep learning models to generate unique images inspired by famous painting styles. The result is a visual representation of sound that blends the harmonic richness of audio with the brushstrokes and color palettes of iconic artists.
